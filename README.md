# User Details Project

## Description

This project involves a form that collects data from the user and displays it in a table. The form is aesthetically pleasing and includes form validations using the Formik library. A Bootstrap navbar is used for a sample React Router and breadcrumbs are implemented in the app. Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on the table. A local JSON server is used for these operations. The form displays the status of each operation (Read, Update, Delete, or Create) and includes proper error handling. The project follows a proper folder structure and uses ESLint for code quality.

## Features

- **Form Data Collection:** Collect user data through a well-designed form.
- **Form Validations:** Validate form inputs using the Formik library.
- **Bootstrap Navbar:** Navigate using a Bootstrap navbar.
- **React Router and Breadcrumbs:** Implement navigation with React Router and breadcrumbs.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the user table.
- **Local JSON Server:** Use a local JSON server for data operations.
- **Operation Status Display:** Show the status of each operation (Read, Update, Delete, Create) on the form.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handle errors during operations.
- **Code Quality:** Follow a proper folder structure and ensure code quality with ESLint.

## Getting Started




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3030`

Runs the JSON server.\
It watches for changes in `db.json` and serves the API on port 3030.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
